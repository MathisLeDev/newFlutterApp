# Weather App

Welcome to my Weather App ! 

## Getting Started

Before you begin, please make sure you have installed Flutter and Dart SDK on your system. Here are the links to the installation guides:

- [Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/)
- [Dart installation guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

## Running the App

Once you have installed Flutter and Dart SDK, you can run the app by following these steps:

1. Open the `main.dart` file located in the `lib` directory.
2. Execute the file.
3. That's it! You can now enter a city name and press the + button to see its current weather, as well as daily and weekly forecasts with temperature and weather details.
4. It's recommended to launch it with Chrome so you can change resolution per devices.

Currently, the generated apk doesn't seems to work on virtual and physical devices. I have no idea how to resolve this problem.
But it's still available on desktop with visual studio code and in debug option though.


PS: in case you want to build another APK. Here's the command:

    flutter build apk --release

Thank you for using my Weather App!
